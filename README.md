👕🌦 Smart Clothes Recommendation System

“Your AI-powered personal stylist – Suggesting the perfect outfit based on weather, occasion, body type, and local fashion trends.”

✨ About the Project

This project is a smart clothing recommendation system that goes beyond simple weather-based suggestions. It combines weather conditions, local dressing culture, personal preferences, and body type to suggest the most suitable outfit for the user.

The system even generates a 3D model wearing the recommended outfit, so the user can visualize the look before choosing.

🎯 Features

🌦 Weather-Based Suggestions → Recommends clothes based on temperature, humidity, and rain.

🏙 Locality Style Awareness → Adapts suggestions according to the dressing sense of your area.

🎉 Occasion Mode → Get recommendations for casual wear, parties, weddings, or professional events.

🧍 Personalized by Body Type → Takes into account user’s fitness, body shape, and skin tone.

👗 3D Outfit Preview → Generates a model wearing the suggested clothes so the user can see how it looks.

💡 Interactive Styling → Asks users what they personally like and adapts recommendations accordingly.

🚀 Tech Stack

Frontend: React + TailwindCSS + Three.js (for 3D models)

Backend: Node.js / Express

Database: MongoDB

APIs: Weather API (OpenWeather / WeatherAPI)

AI / Logic: Recommendation engine (custom rules + ML model for personalization)

🎉 Select occasion (casual, party, wedding, etc.).

🤖 AI combines all inputs → suggests best outfit.

🕶 A 3D model is generated → showing the user how the outfit looks.
